# List_App

https://mariokool.github.io/list-app/

A simple list app to use as your to-do list or shopping list. 

I originally wanted to make myself a simple to-do list application, because I was often forgetting things. By time I decided to upload this version to github, I had probably made about 5 different similar applications beforehand. Some of them, I had magically misplaced in a such way, that they are no longer recoverable (only design files are left).

Originally I really liked the design, it left a cool frosted glass effect, but soon realised it was hard to read. So I decided to update it and go for a more traditional style. Though soon that project became a project on its own. The successor is called day planner (see my repo).
